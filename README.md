# causal-inference-brasdefer-pawelczyk

### Will's Instructions:
1) Choose a paper; hopefully from another course.
It should address a policy question/ assess a policy's impact

2) Provide a 'Critique' of its methods from a Causal perspective.
'Critique' = take it apart, look at it... you don't necessarily have to 'criticize' it. This project is explanatory, not about making some convincing argument.
This should be the largest section of the assignment.

3) Present a proposal to 'remedy' any weak points/ what should have been done differently.

4) Suggest how to extend the research in a causally-relevant way.
Provide detail and don't forget to motivate it (why would it be relevant/ important?).
Focus less on saying "We want to collect 5000 people by random messaging from February to April in...", and instead say "having a Control Group would solve Bias".


Administrative:
HTML or PDF only
Writing style should be "Internal Technical Report", not a Policy Brief. 
The paper should have a technical focus and conversational tone.
Assume Will has read the paper.
