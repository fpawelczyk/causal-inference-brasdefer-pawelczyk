# Abstract 

Results between Logistic, XGBoost, and RandomForest models are assessed, with the RandomForest _(F1 = .67)_ proving
strongest.

# Proposed Method 



## Experiments 

**Data**: This project utilized song data taken from directly
from Spotify playlists. Every year, Spotify releases a *top-100 Songs* playlist for each of their customers that provides their most listened songs of that year. Playlists
ranging from 2016 to 2021 were used for the three individuals in the group, and the playlists were chosen because they
are the most efficient way of illustrating the music tastes of
each individual. In order to pull this song data into Python,
Spotipy was used. Spotipy is a lightweight Python library
for the Spotify Web API. With Spotipy, you are able to gain
full access to all of the music data provided by the Spotify
platform.






**Experimental details**: We decided to proceed with three
different classification models to work with our newly created Spotify data that contained information on the three
individuals. These were: Logistic Regression, XGBoost,
and Random Forest. Each will be discussed in details in the
following paragraphs.

```{r fig4, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = '100%', fig.cap = "Random Forest parameters to test."}
#knitr::include_graphics("figures/rf_para_test.png")
```



**Results**: As mentioned during the Experiment Details

## Acknowledgments 

One of our initial inspirations for this particular project
came from Adam Reevesman’s article on Towards Data Science^[https://towardsdatascience.com/spotify-wrapped-data-visualization-and-machine-learning-on-your-top-songs-1d3f837a9b27]. It provided a framework for how Spotipy can be used
to gather information about an individual’s song preferences
and encouraged us to pursue this idea further. Additionally,
the code he utilized to pull and clean the data from Spotify was essential in ensuring that we had a well structured data
file to work with as we built out our three models.
